# RLOpt framework

This repository contains the Visual Basic implementation of RLOpt, a framework for autonomous reinforcement learning that uses Bayesian optimization. This was presented in 2017 as a conference paper [(link)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8226439) in the Latin American Computer Conference (CLEI), and published in 2018 as an extended version in the CLEI Electronic Journal [(link)](https://clei.org/cleiej/index.php/cleiej/article/view/33). The slides of the presentation of the paper can be found [here](https://github.com/jbarsce/RLOptVB/blob/master/CLEI%20Slides.pdf).

To run RLOpt or other optimizers (or individual agents), choose a Test Class to run from the Main module (for example TestBayesianOptimization), and then choose a test method in order to perform simulations. Two output files are produced after each optimizer meta-episode: a .csv file that stores the raw data of the simulation (the diferent hyper-parameter used among with the function results) and a .txt file that shows the details of each meta-episode.
